# What the project does:
The project provides the user with an array of buttons labeled with popular villains.
Upon clicking them, they will fill the page with GIFs pulled from the popular website "Giphy".
They also have the option of adding/removing their own buttons.

# Why the project is useful:
The project demonstrates the coder's ability to manipulate: 
- Information from API searches using AJAX queries
- On-click event listeners to dynamically created content
- The setting/clearing of LocalStorage on the user's end
- Multiple functions using both local and global variables

# How users can get started with the project
Begin by clicking on the buttons to display static GIFs from Giphy. 
Click on the GIFs to animate them. Click again to stop.
Type in your own villain and add the button to the display. Note that you can't add blank buttons or buttons that are already there.
Click the Removal button to get rid of user-added buttons and clear the localStorage.
